# Investigation-of-Learning-Based-Tractography-via-TractSeg

The reconstruction of white matter fiber bundles using non-invasive diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is useful for studying brain connectivity. However, accurate fiber reconstruction remains a challenging problem. Here, we explore the use of the TractSeg model to tackle fiber reconstruction as a machine-learning problem. We use microstructure-informed fiber filtering techniques, such as COMMIT, to build our own dataset for training the model. We find that the use of a high-quality tractogram during training improves fiber reconstruction. Although our strategy yields fewer streamlines, it retains major connectivity information. Our findings support the importance of using quality controlled data for model training to improve the outcome of learning-based tractography methods such as TractSeg.
